## Description / story of the game
You have been underground for days when suddenly the path back to the surface collapses leaving you trapped in the bunker. There is no breathable air outside your bunker in the cave and even the air inside your bunker is limited and will not last forever. You need to dig your way out and back to the surface! You need to be careful though and make supports for the path you're digging so it doesn't suffer the same fate as the others...
